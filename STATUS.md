# Status

## Current
- Authored `diorama_template.blend` and `material_library.blend` with placeholder assets/materials.
- Exported proof assets `house_01` and `school_hall_shell_01` and wired them into layouts.
- Full pipeline `build_content.gd` completes with Validator pass; navpoly bake uses `NavigationServer2D`.

## Next
- Verify scenes in the editor and confirm plate rendering.
- Replace placeholder Blender assets/materials with real design-kit textures.
