# Status

## Current
- Generated concept-derived design-kit textures in `art/design_kit/` and wired them into `material_library.blend`.
- Added variant B materials/textures for wood, stone, plaster, and roof tiles.
- Updated `diorama_template.blend` to use textured materials and re-exported `house_01` and `school_hall_shell_01`.
- Full pipeline `build_content.gd` completes with Validator pass; navpoly bake uses `NavigationServer2D`.

## Next
- Verify scenes in the editor and confirm plate rendering.
- Use `F9` for clean screenshot captures.
- Replace placeholder design-kit textures with final kit assets when available.
