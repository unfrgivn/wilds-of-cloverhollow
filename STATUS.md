# Status

## Current
- Generated concept-derived design-kit textures in `art/design_kit/` and wired them into `material_library.blend`.
- Added variant B materials/textures for wood, stone, plaster, and roof tiles.
- Rebuilt town building props with trims, doors, windows, and roof overhangs; re-exported `house_01`, `house_timber_01/02`, `house_stone_01/02`, `shop_01`, `school_01_exterior`, and `school_hall_shell_01`.
- Updated `town_square_01/ground.png` with a watercolor plaza plate based on concept palettes.
- Full pipeline `build_content.gd` completes with Validator pass; navpoly bake uses `NavigationServer2D`.

## Next
- Verify scenes in the editor and confirm plate rendering.
- Use `F9` for clean screenshot captures.
- Replace placeholder design-kit textures with final kit assets when available.
