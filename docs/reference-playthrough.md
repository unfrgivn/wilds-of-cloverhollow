# Reference Playthrough (EarthBound) — How to Use It

The user provided a full YouTube playlist of the EarthBound playthrough (entire game).
This repo does **not** embed or mirror that content; it is used as a design reference only.

## What to extract (for Cloverhollow)

When watching, focus on *patterns*:
- How often the player transitions between exterior and interiors
- How frequently the “Talk/Check” action yields flavor text
- How the game communicates locked paths (blocked exits, hints)
- How UI windows behave (open/close cadence, readability)
- How battles are triggered from the overworld (future system)
- How scene-to-scene continuity is maintained (spawn points)

## Deliverables for notes (recommended)

Create a short internal note doc (not necessarily committed) with:
- a list of interaction types to replicate (signs, phones, bins, beds, etc.)
- 3–5 examples of “weird but funny” writing tone targets
- a checklist of transition patterns (fade length, spawn distance from door)
- a shortlist of battle presentation ideas (for later)
