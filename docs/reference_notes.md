# Reference Notes — Layout-Authoritative Prototype Constraints

## Display + Resolution
- Prototype internal size: 1280x720 (user-selected target for Switch-style indie prototype).
- Legacy reference: previous project used 640x480 internal with 1280x960 window override and stretch mode `viewport`.

## Camera + Presentation
- Camera zoom: 1x (session notes).
- Perspective target: top-down/oblique; interiors staged as cutaway dioramas (art direction).
- Optional: low-resolution SubViewport toggle for “SNES cohesiveness” (art direction/spec).

## Platforms
- Desktop targets (Windows/macOS/Linux) for demo (spec).

## Naming Conventions
- No explicit naming convention guidance found in docs/README beyond standard Godot scene paths.
