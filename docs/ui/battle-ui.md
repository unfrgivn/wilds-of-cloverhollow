# Battle UI (v0)

## Goals
- Fast readability on iPhone landscape.
- Minimal theming to start; box UI is fine.
- No cassette theming; do not reference cassette/player devices.

## Layout baseline
- Top HUD:
  - Party: portraits + HP/MP + status icons
  - Enemies: names + HP (bar or numeric) + status icons
- Bottom/side:
  - Command menu boxes (Attack / Skill / Item / Defend / Run)
  - Context/help box (shows selected action description)

## Interaction
- Touch-friendly selection.
- Keyboard navigation is acceptable for early development/testing.

## Visual constraints
- Use global UI palette colors.
- Keep font large enough to read on iPhone landscape.
