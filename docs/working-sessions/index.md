# Working sessions

This folder is the “how we work” playbook. It is written so you can:
- start a new agent session without re-reading chat history,
- keep decisions centralized in `spec.md`,
- and ship incrementally with reliable automated playtests.

## Start here
- `master-prompt.md` — copy/paste prompts for starting sessions (Product Architect + Coding Agent)
- `plan.md` — detailed milestone plan (engineering + art pipeline + content production)
- `biome-workshop.md` — repeatable process for designing and adding a new biome pack
