# Working session master prompt (reference)

If you are not using `/next-milestone`, copy/paste this as a baseline session prompt.

- Read: spec.md, AGENTS.md, docs/working-sessions/plan.md
- Pick one milestone and complete it end-to-end.
- Do not ask questions; create future milestones for missing input.
- Run required scripts; commit once per milestone.
